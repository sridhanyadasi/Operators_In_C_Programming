# C Operators 
This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly C programs 
to understand Operators in C, their types, syntax, and usage 
with clear examples.

## 🔹 What are Operators in C?

Operators are special symbols used to perform operations 
on variables and values (operands).

👉 In simple words:
Operators = Action symbols

Example:
a + b
Here, '+' is an operator.
🔹 Why Are Operators Used?
We use operators to:

Perform calculations

Compare values

Assign values

Make decisions

Perform logical operations

Manipulate bits

Increment or decrement values

Without operators, we cannot perform any operations in programming.

🔹 Types of Operators in C
C provides the following main types of operators:

Arithmetic Operators

Relational Operators

Logical Operators

Assignment Operators

Increment & Decrement Operators

Bitwise Operators

Conditional (Ternary) Operator

Special Operators

🔹 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical calculations.

Operator	Meaning
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
/	Division
%	Modulus
Syntax:
int result = a + b;

🔹 2️⃣ Relational Operators
Used to compare two values.

Operator	Meaning
==	Equal to
!=	Not equal to
>	Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater than or equal
<=	Less than or equal
Syntax:
if (a > b)

🔹 3️⃣ Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions.

Operator	Meaning
&&	Logical AND
!	Logical NOT
Syntax:
if (a > 10 && b < 20)

🔹 4️⃣ Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Example
=	a = 10
+=	a += 5
-=	a -= 5
*=	a *= 2
/=	a /= 2
%=	a %= 2
Syntax:
a += 5;

🔹 5️⃣ Increment & Decrement Operators
Used to increase or decrease value by 1.

Operator	Meaning
++	Increment
--	Decrement
Syntax:
a++;
++a;

🔹 6️⃣ Bitwise Operators
Used to perform operations at bit level.

Operator	Meaning
&	AND
^	XOR
~	NOT
<<	Left Shift
>>	Right Shift
Syntax:
a & b;

🔹 7️⃣ Conditional (Ternary) Operator
Used as short form of if-else.

Syntax:
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
Example:

max = (a > b) ? a : b;

🔹 8️⃣ Special Operators
Examples:

sizeof()

Comma operator (,)

Address operator (&)

Pointer operator (*)

Example:

sizeof(int);

🔹 Purpose of This Repository
✔ To understand all types of operators clearly
✔ To practice operator examples with programs
✔ To learn operator precedence and hierarchy
✔ To strengthen C programming fundamentals
✔ To prepare for interviews and exams
